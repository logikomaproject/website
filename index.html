        <h1>SecTalks Melbourne CTF</h1>

        <p>Let’s have some fun with SubDomain Exploitation.<br />
        We’ll be using the domain "mybits.work" for this CTF.</p>

        <p>The first flag, should be relatively easy to find. It will contain information about the other flags.</p>

        <p>During this journey, you many need to create/use your own service accounts to attain some flags. 
        Most of the flags can be found by interrogating public DNS related infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Not sure where to start? <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists">SecLists is your friend</a>.</p>
        
        
        <br /> <br /> 
        <p>There are no active attacks in this CTF.<br /> 
        Please <strong>do not</strong> attack any of the infrastructure. You should be able to complete all the challenges with OSINT and Passive Recon tools.
        If you find a bug/exploit, let the organisers know immediately. Be nice, or the CTF could go down for everyone.</p>

        <p>Good luck. Have fun.</p>
