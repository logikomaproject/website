    <h1>SecTalks Melbourne CTF</h1>

    <p>Let’s have some fun with SubDomain Exploitation.<br />
    We’ll be using the domain "mybits.work for this CTF.</p>

    <p>The first flag, should be relatively easy to find. It will contain information about the other flags.</p>

    <p>During this journey, you many need to create/use your own service accounts to attain some flags. Most of the flags can be found by interrogating public DNS related infrastructure.</p>

    <p>There are no active attacks in this CTF. Please <strong>do not</strong> attack any of the infrastructure.
    If you find a bug/exploit, let the organisers know immediately. Be nice, or we’ll terminate the CTF for all.</p>

    <p>Good luck. Have fun.</p>

    <p>If you’ve succeeded in Challenge 2, you’ll see a picture below:<br />
