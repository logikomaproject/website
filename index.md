# SecTalks Melbourne CTF

Let's have some fun with SubDomain Takeover.
We'll be using the domain `mybits.work` for this CTF.

During this journey, you many need to create/use your own service accounts to attain the flags.
You should be able to get most of the flags by interrogating public DNS resolvers.

There is no active attacks in this CTF. Please do not attack any of the infrastructure.
If you find a bug/exploit, let the organisers know. Be nice, or we'll terminate the CTF for all.

Good luck. Have fun.
