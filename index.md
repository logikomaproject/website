# SecTalks Melbourne CTF

Let's have some fun with SubDomain Exploitation.<br />
We'll be using the domain `mybits.work` for this CTF.

During this journey, you many need to create/use your own service accounts to attain some flags. Most of the flags can be found by interrogating public DNS related infrastructure.

There are no active attacks in this CTF. Please **do not** attack any of the infrastructure.
If you find a bug/exploit, let the organisers know immediately. Be nice, or we'll terminate the CTF for all.

Good luck. Have fun.
