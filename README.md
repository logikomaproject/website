Subdomain Exploitation CTF
----------------------------
for SecTalks Melbourne, May 2018

#Welcome
Hello friend,

Well, if you're here, it's likely that you've completed the CTF, or were given this repository's URL.
If the prior, congratulations! I hope you had fun :)

If you played this CTF, it'll be really helpful to get your feedback, so that we can improve; or just tell us you liked it.
Do open an "Issue" on the repository, or send it via Twitter to @sectalks_MEL / @hellodanielting or via Slack.


#What's the CTF about?
The focus of this CTF is to help develop a better understanding subdomain/domain misconfigurations and information discovery.
The CTF currently covers the follows :
 - Retrieving DNS Records
 - SubDomain Enumeration
 - Exposed Subdomain Resources
 - Dangling Subdomain takeover
 - Using Certificate Transparency logs to find subdomains

I intended to have a mailspoofing with valid SPF records component to it, but, didn't have time to implement it.
Just in-case there's any doubt, this was intended to be beginner friendly, and without any active attacks. If you're a l33t hax0r, please help add to the CTF. I too am learning this, and could really use your guidance.


#Usage & Further Development
The intention here is to release the CTF source code itself under the GPL License; for anyone interested. If you'd like to contribute, just submit a pull-request.

The intention here is that this be the beginning of a more fully fleged CTF with more domain related attacks. I'll do a writeup about what the files are, and how to use it, but really should be quite self-explainatory.

For clarity, Daniel will retain all ownership rights to the domain, `mybits.work`, and the infrastructure.

Cheers,
@hoodie (on SecTalks Slack)
